osx-keyboard-layouts
====================

Additional keyboard layouts for OSX.

Available layouts:
* Polish Dvorak

=== Installation guide ===
Drag and drop to /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ directory.
Then you need to log out and log in again.
Then change your keyboard layout and use it.

If you want to customize existing keyboard layouts or create
new layouts, I recommend Ukelele application [ http://scripts.sil.org/Ukelele ].
